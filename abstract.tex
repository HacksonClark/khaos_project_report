\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Khaos} is a hardware failure injection framework that enables systematic testing of system resilience to low-level faults. By leveraging eBPF, Khaos intercepts syscalls and simulates realistic failure modes such as disk I/O errors, memory exhaustion, and network disruption faults. Unlike traditional chaos engineering tools that focus on high-level service disruptions, Khaos provides fine-grained control over fault injection at the syscall layer, allowing developers to evaluate how their software behaves under adverse hardware conditions. Khaos includes a growing suite of fault scenarios implemented with \texttt{bpf\_override\_return}, simple template programs for easy extensibility, and a lightweight command-line interface to select target processes. Through fault simulation at the kernel boundary, Khaos offers a practical foundation to enhance hardware fault tolerance in infrastructure software.
